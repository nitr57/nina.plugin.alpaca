This plugin exposes all N.I.N.A. devices as Alpaca devices over the network, enabling control of your equipment from any ASCOM/Alpaca-compliant software or client. Each device is tightly integrated with N.I.N.A.'s interface abstractions, ensuring seamless operation and access to N.I.N.A.'s advanced features.

Additionally, exposing devices via Alpaca allows native or in-process drivers in N.I.N.A. to be shared with other applications.

Tip: For applications that cannot natively connect to Alpaca devices, you can use the ASCOM Chooser to make Alpaca drivers accessible as ASCOM drivers. See [Alpaca through the Chooser](https://ascom-standards.org/Help/Platform/html/e3870a2f-582a-4ab4-b37f-e9b1c37a2030.htm) in the ASCOM documentation for setup instructions.
